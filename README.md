## My process

- I set up the base project by _creating the GitHub repository_, _setting up global styling_, _including the required assets_, and so on. I then proceeded to code the _header_ and _footer_ sections of the project and after I was done, then i worked on the _Hero_ and _Gallery_ sections.

  During the entire project life cycle i followed courses online to get  thoughts and ideas on how to make the project meet web standards and kept track of our overall progress.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

### What We learned

-  Before this project, I had no idea that you could set mutliple images to show for different screen sizes using the `<picture>` element.

```html
<picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="./images/mobile/image-stand-out.jpg">
        <source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="./images/mobile/image-stand-out.jpg">
        <img src="./images/mobile/image-stand-out.jpg" alt="cup image">
</picture>
```

### Continued development

-  I want to apply the features and best practices that I've learnt from working on this project to future projects.
